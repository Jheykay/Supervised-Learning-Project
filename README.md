# Supervised-Learning-Project
I recently completed a project as part of the Supervised Learning Foundations course, where I developed a linear regression model aimed at predicting the prices of used phones and tablets. The project, titled "ReCell," focused on identifying key factors influencing device pricing, such as brand, operating system, specifications, and usage history.
